TLDR; you are expected to submit a link to a self-contained code repository in the cloud. There is no report to submit.

Provide the link to your github repository containing your project at the top of your #team-pX-X channel using the “+Add a bookmark” feature. 

You need to also submit a zip folder of your entire repository onto xsite in order for us to account for your submission as well.

Your repo should contain:

    the full source code of your prototype
    all the issues you have used to track every development task that is done for the project. Whether you use Agile or not, you need to use the issues to track tasks delegated to different members (so it is important all issues have assignees).
    a README.md file with the details below...


Sections required in README.md

“How to run” section

    keep it straight to the point of how to access the entry point of the web app
    any necessary dependencies to run it


“Development Workflow” section

    provide a brief yet sufficiently comprehensive description of your team’s workflow using git and GitHub features


“UAT” section

    include an updated use case diagram and system state diagram if there are changes made based on M2. Highlight the changes clearly.
    an embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
    ~3 mins long to cover all system tests


“Whitebox Testing” section

    choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. Please do not use an Entity class.
    list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
    show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
    provide instructions how to run the test suite
    embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
